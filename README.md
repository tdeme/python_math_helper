# Python Math Helper

## Project Goals
The objectives of this project were pretty open-ended. All I really knew was that I wanted to make something that could help people with math, and that I wanted to learn somethin in the process. Here are the goals I eventually landed upon:

1. Make an interpreter/parser that can evaluate four-function mathematical expressions with order of operations in mind
2. Make a calculator app using tkinter that makes use of the interpreter/parser which ordinary people can use
